<!--Web workers is an asynchronous system, or protocol, for web pages to execute tasks in the background, 
    independently from the main thread and website UI. It is an isolated environment that is insulated from 
    the window object, the document object, direct internet access and is best suited for long-running or demanding computational tasks.
-->
<!--Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support Web Workers.-->
